# VanillaEnhanced

This mod adds a few things to enhance the Vanilla experience.  
If you have any suggestions for new things, feel free to shoot me a message.
*Still in development*

## V6.0 only, there is no backwards compatibility for older versions

This is not because i'm lazy, but because of the major changes of V6.
